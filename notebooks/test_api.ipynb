These methods have provided quantitative information on the effects of inhibitors on enzymes ,  but none on the localized effects of inhibitors on selected sites of action within the animal .  Histochemical study of frozen sections does provide data on the site of action of toxicants .  The utility of histochemistry in conjunction with in vitro methods is discussed .  The substrates acetylthiocholine and phenyl thioacetate were utilized in demonstrating cholinesterase .  Neither substrate penetrated well into freshly dissected nerve cord preparations ,  but both compounds were hydrolysed by sectioned tissue .  The leaving group of phenyl thioacetate was demonstrated to be benzenethiol .  In general ,  acetylthiocholine was hydrolysed slightly more rapidly by insect cholinesterases .  A unique cholinesterase was found in motor end - plates of cricket muscle ,  which hydrolyses acetylthiocholine and which was inhibited by physostigmine .  No other insect muscle preparation showed this activity .  Topical application of insecticides showed that a vital site of action in flies is the peripheral area of the thoracic ganglia and that in crickets the brain and nerve cord are involved at knock - down .  Kinetic data indicate that acetylthiocholine has a greater affinity than does phenyl thioacetate for a variety of enzyme sources .  Ultrastructural evidence shows that cholinesterases that hydrolyse acetylthiocholine are membrane - bound .  Phenyl thioacetate was found to be useful as a model in designing new insecticides .

The level of induction by 20 mm baikiain is about 10 %  of the maximum level induced by proline .  Since the analogue is a substrate of proline oxidase the first enzyme of the proline catabolic pathway ,  the oxidation derivative rather than baikiain itself might be the actual effector .  Baikiain is also an inducer of proline oxidase in Escherichia coli K - 12 and E .  coli W .  An additional effect of this analogue on proline degradation in S .  typhimurium is inhibition of P5C dehydrogenase .  At a concentration of 5 x 10 (  - 4 ) m ,  baikiain inhibits completely the growth of strains constitutive for proline oxidase .  This inhibition ,  which can be overcome by proline ,  occurs in the presence or absence of P5C dehydrogenase activity .  Three spontaneously occurring mutants resistant to baikiain were isolated from constitutive strains .  All are pleiotropic - negative for the proline - degrading enzymes .  The sites of these mutations are linked to the put region .  Although the mechanism of toxicity has not been determined ,  baikiain provides a simple and direct selection for obtaining mutants unable to degrade proline .  In addition ,  it allows selection for strains with an inducible rather than constitutive phenotype . '}],\n",

The absolute configuration of this hydration product was shown to be l ( S )  - 4 - hydroxy - 2 - oxopentanoate .  Vinylpyruvate hydratase ,  purified almost to homogeneity ,  had a molecular weight of about 287 , 000 and was dissociated in sodium dodecyl sulfate ,  without prior treatment with mercaptoethanol ,  into a species with an approximate molecular weight of 28 , 000 .  The hydratase was highly specific for its substrates ;  thus ,  although 2 - oxo - cis - hex - 4 - enoate was also hydrated ,  structurally similar compounds such as the trans isomer ,  vinylacetic and crotonic acids ,  and the ring - fission products of catechol and methylcatechols were not attacked .

The in vivo metabolism of radioiodinelabeled C1q was determined in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia ,  multiple myeloma ,  systemic lupus erythematosus  ( SLE )  ,  and in healthy controls .  Marked differences in metabolic behavior were observed with a much more rapid disappearance of plasma radioactivity in patients as compared with controls .  Estimated plasma volumes at 10 min after injection  ( time 0 )  were normal in controls and the SLE patient ,  mean 40 ml / kg ,  whereas they were grossly elevated ,  57 - 82 ml / kg ,  in the hypogammaglobulinemic and myeloma patients ,  indicating significant loss of C1q -  ( 125 ) I during the initial mixing period .  Absence of a distinct initial equilibration phase of radioactivity loss from the plasma suggested significant reversible interaction of the labeled C1q with plasma proteins and density gradient studies provided evidence for in vivo uptake into the circulating trimolecular first component complex  ( C1q ,  r ,  s )  .  In controls and the SLE patient 0 . 51 - 0 . 75 of the C1q was retained in the plasma space while only 0 . 28 or less was in the others .  The daily plasma pool fractional C1q catabolism was 0 . 65 - 0 . 67 in controls compared with 0 . 95 - 4 . 80 in the patients .  C1q synthetic rates in controls were 4 . 64 and 4 . 34 mg / kg per day while higher rates ,  4 . 94 - 37 . 40 occurred in the patients .  These experiments clearly indicate that the metabolism of C1q is markedly influenced by serum IgG concentrations ,  probably related to the reversible interactions of C1q with IgG ,  and also affected by interactions with C1r and C1s .  The decreased serum C1q often present in hypogammaglobulinemia and myeloma relates to an increased catabolism and higher extravascular distribution rather than impaired C1q synthesis .  In contrast ,  a second distinctly different basis for decreased C1q occurs in SLE ;  increased utilization by an ongoing immunopathogenic process . '}],\n",

The apparent Michaelis constant for the enzyme obtained from normal rats was found to be 0 . 9 mM choline ;  this value doubled when the animals were killed one hour after a single injection of morphine  ( 30 mg / kg )  .  When the rats were injected daily for 4 or 15 days ,  and killed one hour after the last injection ,  the apparent Km value was 2 . 1 mM in each case .  Prolonged daily treatment with morphine ,  followed by 48 h withdrawal ,  or by administration of 4 mg / kg of naloxone  ( given half an hour after the last injection of morphine )  resulted in apparent Km values of 1 . 3 - 1 . 5 mM of choline ,  suggesting a gradual return to the lower ,  normal substrate requirement .  Vmax changes were insignificant . 3 .  The effect of morphine added in vitro to different enzyme preparations was also studied .  The Km values of 0 . 9 mM ,  in the enzyme isolated from normal rats ,  increased to 2 . 0 after incubation in vitro with 12 . 5 mM morphine .  Similar increases were found in enzymes obtained from rats 48 h after the withdrawal of morphine or from rats injected with naloxone after prolonged morphine treatment .

Return to normal values was observed when morphine was administered daily .  After two to three weeks of daily treatment and subsequent withdrawal from morphine for 48 h ,  the levels of ACh were normal .

End - plate currents have been studied in glycerol - treated frog sartorius nerve - muscle preparations with the voltage clamp technique . 2 .  The effects of temperature on the decay rate of end - plate currents were investigated over a temperature range from 10 to 30 . 5 degrees C .  The Q ( 10 )  for the decay constant of end - plate currents depends somewhat on membrane potential ;  at  -  100 mV the decay constant has a Q ( 10 )  of 2 . 7 . 3 .  Peak end - plate current depends non - linearly on membrane potential with a decreasing slope conductance associated with hyperpolarization . 4 .  The  ; instantaneous '  voltage - current relationship for end - plate channels was determined by causing step changes in membrane potential during end - plate current flow .  This relationship appears to be linear . 5 .  The interaction of acetylcholine with its receptor is viewed as being analogous to the first step in enzymic catalysis .  On this view ,  acetylcholine binds to its receptor and induces a conformational change which is responsible for opening end - plate channels .  By analogy to the first steps in the catalytic sequence of enzymes ,  the binding step is very rapid ,  almost diffusion - limited ,  and the conformational change is rate - limiting . 6 .  Equations describing this process have been derived .  Expressions for the rate constants have also been derived by considering changing dipole moments of the transmitter - receptor complex associated with the conformational change .  As the transmitter - receptor complex is in the membrane field ,  different conformational states have different energies ,  and the rate of conformational change thus depends on membrane potential .  The equations thus derived are shown to account adequately for the time course of end - plate conductance change . \"}],\n",

After inhibition of ACh hydrolysis ,  the removal of the transmitter from the synapse is generally too slow to be accounted for by free diffusion .  It is suggested that diffusion is delayed by binding to post - synaptic receptors .  This is consistent with the finding that receptor blockage by curare or alpha - bungarotoxin shortens as well as reduces quantal transmitter action . 4 .  The correlated effects of the receptor - blocking agents ,  on size and time course of the miniature end - plate currents ,  were subjected to a simple analysis .  Its result suggests that after inhibition of cholinesterase about two thrids of the quantal packet of ACh combines with post - synaptic receptors . 5 .

Studies are presented of the interaction in a physiological ionic environment of aromatic amine local anesthetics  ( prilocaine ,  lidocaine ,  and dimethisoquin )  and Ca +  +  with receptor - rich membrane fragments isolated from Torpedo electric organ .  The environmentaly sensitive fluorophore 1 -  ( 5 - dimethylaminonaphthalene - 1 - sulfonamido ) ethane 2 - trimethylammonium iodide  ( DNS - chol ) interacts with two classes of sites in the membrane fragments :  the cholinergic receptor site and secondary sites characterized by probe emission properties  ( lmax )  sensitive to the pharmacological nature  ( agonist or antagonist )  of the cholinergic ligand bound to the receptor site .  Fluorescence studies show that the local anesthetics cause an increase of affinity of the membrane - bound receptor for DNS - chol and for cholinergic ligands ,  both agonists and antagonists .  The increase of affinity is not associated with a change of DNS - chol emission properties .  At the same concentrations at which the anesthetics control receptor affinity ,  they also affect the fluorescence of DNS - chol bound to the secondary sites :  the presence of local anesthetic causes a loss of the DNS - chol spectral properties characteristic of the binding of agonists to the receptor site .  Local anesthetics also control the binding of  [ 3H ] acetylcholine to the membrane - bound receptor .  In the absence of prilocaine the acetylcholine binding curve is slightly sigmoid  ( Hill coefficient ,  nH  =  1 . 4 ,  half - saturation at 10 nM free acetylcholine )  .  In the presence of 3 mM prilocaine there is a decrease of cooperativity and an increase of affinity  ( nH  =  1 . 0 ,  half - saturation at 6 mM free acetylcholine )  .  The concentrations at which the local anesthetics act on the membrane fragments are those at which they block the permeability response of Electrophorus electroplax upon addition to the bath of the agonist carbamylcholine .  Fluorescence and radioactive ligand assays demonstrate that Ca +  +  also causes an increase of receptor affinity for cholinergic ligands ,  but in a manner significantly different from that observed with local anesthetics .  Solubilization of membrane fragments by detergent leads to changes in the binding properties of the receptor protein .  On the membrane fragments the binding data for each agonist can be analyzed in terms of a homogeneous population of sites ,  while after solubilization heterogeneity of the binding constants appears .  Prilocaine or Ca +  no longer affects the binding of acetylcholine to the solubilized receptor protein .  The observed effects of local anesthetics and Ca +  +  on the affinity of the cholinergic receptor are related to the phenomenon of receptor desensitization . '},\n",

The resistance decreased from 7 . 27  +  /  -  0 . 82 x 10 ( 5 )  ohm cm ( 2 )  in the control membrane to 1 . 83 x 10 ( 5 )  ohm cm ( 2 )  with addition of 72 microg / ml proteolipid .  The decrease in resistance followed a potential function of order four with the proteolipid concentration in the membrane - forming solution .  The presence of this proteolipid determined some type of cationic selectivity which was not observed in the control .  At a critical point of proteolipid concentration the conductance spontaneously fluctuated between two levels .  The membrane current jumped from one state to another by way of single discrete steps ,  reminiscent of those obtained with the excitatory inducing material or the macrocyclic antibiotics .  In membranes containing another proteolipid having no cholinergic binding properties ,  the increase in conductance was smaller ,  and had a linear function with the concentration .  In this case the  \" flip flop \"  fluctuation and the cationic selectivity were not observed .  The membranes containing the cholinergic proteolipid reacted to the addition of acetylcholine by a rapid and transient increase in conductance that was considerably reduced or abolished by a previous application of d - tubocurarine .

Successive leaf sections from the base to the tip of rapidly developing leaves of 7 - day - old maize  ( Zea mays var .  Kelvedon Glory )  ,  grown in the light ,  utilized acetate for fatty acid biosynthesis in a very divergent manner .  Basal regions of the leaf containing proplastids synthesized insignificant proportions of unsaturated fatty acids and appreciable proportions of fatty acids with 20 or more carbon atoms .  An increase in the light intensity during incubations with acetate - 1 -  ( 14 ) C resulted in very little enhancement of either total or polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis in this tissue .  When the distal leaf sections ,  containing mesophyll chloroplasts with well developed grana and bundle sheath chloroplasts without grana ,  were incubated with acetate at 150 ft - c and 30 C ,  approximately 30 %  of the newly synthesized fatty acids were unsaturated  ( mainly 18 :  1 and 18 :  2 )  .  At 2800 ft - c and 20 C ,  60 %  of the fatty acids were unsaturated and the total synthesis of fatty acids increased 4 - fold .  No detectable amount of fatty acids with 20 or more carbon atoms were synthesized in this morphologically mature tissue ,  and the proportions of newly synthesized fatty acids more closely resembled the endogenous fatty acids in the immature tissue .  Only 4 %  of the newly synthesized fatty acids were 18 :  3 but most of this was incorporated into monogalactolipid .  In the distal sections ,  20 to 25 %  of the newly synthesized fatty acids in monogalactolipid were 18 :  3 compared with the endogenous proportions of 85 %  .  The differences in the composition of the newly synthesized fatty acids and the endogenous fatty acids appear to be related very largely to the low rate of 18 :  3 biosynthesis from 18 :  1 and 18 :  2 .  Phosphatidyl choline and phosphatidyl ethanolamine ,  with lower proportions of 18 :  3 ,  contained radioactive fatty acids which resembled the endogenous composition more closely .  Phosphatidyl choline was quantitatively the most important acyl lipid synthesized under both light conditions .  In addition ,  there was considerable stimulation of acetate incorporation into phosphatidyl glycerol and monogalactolipid ,  especially in the morphologically most mature regions of the tissue at the higher light intensity .
