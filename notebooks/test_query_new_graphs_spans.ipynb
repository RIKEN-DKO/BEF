Antimelanoma antibodies previously demonstrated in the serum of melanoma patients by immunofluorescence have now been detected by a sensitive and quantitative complement fixation technique .  The melanoma - specific antibodies detected by both of these techniques show a remarkable correlation with the stage of disease .  Study of serums from 63 melanoma patients showed that both the incidence and titer of antibodies to the tumor antigens of malignant melanoma were found to be higher in patients with localized melanoma than in those with widespread metastatic disease .  Furthermore ,  study of serial serum specimens on melanoma patients revealed a drop in antibody titer to undetectable levels with advancing metastatic disease .  Additional evidence for the importance of immunological factors in this disease came from studies of delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity in melanoma patients .  All patients with localized melanoma were capable of being sensitized to DNCB ,  whereas all patients who could not manifest delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity to this chemical had widespread metastatic disease .  Eight melanoma patients were treated with immunotherapy using BCG as an immunological adjuvant .  This therapy produced a rising titer of antimelanoma antibody and temporary tumor regression in five patients .  However ,  only one of these patients has had a complete regression and remains free of disease at two years following treatment .  There was a good correlation between the patient ' s immunological competence and his response to immunotherapy .  All patients who could be sensitized to DNCB or tuberculin and developed a fourfold rise in antibody titer had some response to immunotherapy ,  whereas anergic patients failed to respond to this therapy .  These studies indicate that the host immune response to malignant melanoma is an important factor in controlling the progression of this disease .  Therefore ,  immunotherapy may become a useful adjunct to the primary surgical therapy of malignant melanoma . \"},\n",

The levels of viral infectivity and complement - fixing  ( CF )  antigens revealed that the rates of appearance of infectious particles and CF antigens were not synchronous .  Viral specific CF antigen could be detected 5 h after infection ,  whereas viral infectivity or the appearance of viral particles could be demonstrated only after 10 h of infection .  High proportions of the recovered CF antigens during the various stages of the infectious cycle were found to be soluble and did not sediment with the virus particles .  Cytological analysis of the developmental stages of the JM virus - infected cells by thin sectioning and electron microscopy revealed that at 8 h small particles approximately 35 nm in diameter appeared in the cell nuclei .  The appearance of nucleocapsids occurred at 10 h ,  and these were of varying shapes ;  however ,  all were approximately 100 nm in diameter .

The persistent infection of embryonic chicken tracheal organ cultures with Newcastle disease virus  ( NDV )  is described .  Tracheal explants remained morphologically intact and were able to support the replication of NDV for 6 months .  Peak titers of released virus occurred at 1 week postinfection ,  whereas maximal immunofluorescence was not observed until 30 days postinfection .  The inoculum titer was not critical ,  and viral persistence resulted with either of two strains of NDV tested .  Serum was not required in the medium for explant viability or to maintain the persistent infection .  The presence of a contaminating virus morphologically resembling a leukovirus neither altered the course of infection nor affected the survivability of explants .  Although interferon was not detected in the culture medium ,  persistently infected explants were resistant to heterologous viral challenge ,  and a similar resistant state could be induced in uninfected explants with exogenous interferon or ultraviolet light - inactivated NDV .  No evidence was found to implicate antibody as a regulatory factor in the establishment or maintenance of persistence .  The results from electron microscopy and immunofluorescence suggest the cells of the subepithelial connective tissue as the site of NDV persistence . '},\n",

For example ,  NDV - C was more efficient in initiating infection of chicken cells at 22 C than was NDV - H ;  the reverse was true when human cells were employed .  The results indicate that infection of susceptible cells by NDV is influenced by the host cell in which the virus was propagated .

Methods have been developed for the removal of retinol from human plasma retinol - binding protein  ( RBP )  ,  so as to form the retinol - free apoprotein ,  and for the recombination of apo - RBP with retinol to again form the holoprotein .  Retinol is removed from RBP by gently shaking a solution of RBP with heptane under controlled conditions .  During the shaking ,  retinol is gradually extracted from the RBP and into the heptane phase .  The reassociation of apo - RBP with retinol is achieved by exposing a solution of apo - RBP to Celite coated with a thin film of retinol ,  followed by isolation of the RBP by gel filtration on Sephadex G - 100 .  This procedure results in the recombination of apo - RBP with an amount of retinol almost identical with that previously removed by extraction .  The two - phase extraction procedure was used to explore some of the factors which affect the interaction of retinol with RBP .  The retinol - RBP complex was most stable in the lower portion of the pH range 5 . 6 to 10 .

Adhesion of Sarcoma I cells  ( SaI )  to untreated or to serum - treated glass was examined by layering  ( 51 ) Cr - labeled cells on the substrate for 20 min at 34 degrees C and determining the glass - bound radioactivity after the monolayers were rinsed .  Adhesion to untreated glass proceeded in sodium chloride - imidazole - potassium medium  ( SIK )  without added divalent cations ,  whereas SaI adhered maximally to the serum - coated substrate only in the presence of 50 microM or more Mn .  Divalent Mg ,  Ca ,  Co ,  Ni ,  or Zn were inactive or minimally active .  Mn - stimulated adhesion was sharply temperature dependent ,  reversible upon removal of Mn ,  and inhibited by Ca as well as by cytochalasin B ,  vinblastine ,  or tetracaine .  Adhesion of SaI in SIK did not ensue when cells or the coated substrate were pretreated with Mn and washed in SIK before the adhesion assays .  Microscope observations showed that Mn induced the formation of cell processes ,  ruffles ,  and veils ,  and that SaI spread on the uncoated or serum - coated substrate when exposed to Mn .  Cells withdrew veils and processes and rounded up when postincubated in Mn - free medium .  Formation of cell processes and spreading was inhibited by cytochalasin B ,  vinblastine ,  or tetracaine .  Manganese - induced adhesion seems to require the participation of microtubules and microfilaments and may be mediated by an effect of Mn on Ca fluxes .  The results support the role of cell processes and spreading in cell - to - substrate adhesion . '}]},\n",

Peritoneal macrophages from guinea pigs vaccinated with strain Rev I of Brucella melitensis were only moderately activated thereby to limit ,  in an in vitro system ,  the intracellular growth of Rev I bacilli .  Nevertheless ,  the appropriate memory cells had been primed ,  as demonstrated by the observation that reinfection of animals with virulent B .  melitensis followed by intraperitoneal inoculation of mineral oil called forth macrophages in immunized guinea pigs which inhibited strongly the intracellular growth of brucellae .  These macrophages slowed the growth of brucellae in the absence of immune serum .  The intensity of the recall response was related to the challenge route and to the virulence of the challenge strain .  After equal doses of attenuated or virulent brucellae ,  resistance was highest in macrophages recalled by the virulent strain .  An important basis for the attenuation of the Rev I strain may lie in its initially low degree of macrophage activation during primary infection ,  although still retaining the capacity to prime stem cells .  This property is associated with a protein found in fraction I ,  because 600 mug / ml in Freund ' s adjuvant primed guinea pigs so that challenge by strain 6015 evoked activated macrophages .

A sensitive and quantitative nucleic acid hybridization assay for the detection of radioactively labeled avian tumor virus - specific RNA in infected chicken cells has been developed .  In our experiments we made use of the fact that DNA synthesized by virions of avian myeloblastosis virus in the presence of actinomycin D  ( AMV DNA )  is complementary to at least 35 %  of the sequences of 70S RNA from the Schmidt - Ruppin strain  ( SRV )  of Rous sarcoma virus .  Annealing of radioactive RNA  ( either SRV RNA or RNA extensively purified from SRV - infected chicken cells )  with AMV DNA followed by ribonuclease digestion and Sephadex chromatography yielded products which were characterized as avian tumor virus - specific RNA - DNA hybrids by hybridization competition with unlabeled 70S AMV RNA ,  equilibrium density - gradient centrifugation in Cs ( 2 ) SO ( 4 )  gradients ,  and by analysis of their ribonucleotide composition .

Methods have been developed for the removal of retinol from human plasma retinol - binding protein  ( RBP )  ,  so as to form the retinol - free apoprotein ,  and for the recombination of apo - RBP with retinol to again form the holoprotein .  Retinol is removed from RBP by gently shaking a solution of RBP with heptane under controlled conditions .  During the shaking ,  retinol is gradually extracted from the RBP and into the heptane phase .  The reassociation of apo - RBP with retinol is achieved by exposing a solution of apo - RBP to Celite coated with a thin film of retinol ,  followed by isolation of the RBP by gel filtration on Sephadex G - 100 .  This procedure results in the recombination of apo - RBP with an amount of retinol almost identical with that previously removed by extraction .  The two - phase extraction procedure was used to explore some of the factors which affect the interaction of retinol with RBP .  The retinol - RBP complex was most stable in the lower portion of the pH range 5 . 6 to 10 .  The rate of removal of retinol from the RBP - prealbumin complex  ( the form in which RBP normally circulates in plasma )  was markedly less than the rate of its removal from RBP alone .  The interaction of retinol with RBP appears to be stabilized by the formation of the RBP - prealbumin complex .  The recombination procedure was employed to examine the specificity of the binding of retinol to RBP ,  by determining whether compounds other than all - trans - retinol would effectively bind to apo - RBP .  Apo - RBP did not bind cholesterol ,  but displayed a slight affinity for phytol .  The affinity of RBP for beta - carotene was minimal ,  whereas both retinyl acetate and retinal were bound about one - third as effectively as all - trans - retinol .  In contrast ,  retinoic acid bound to apo - RBP almost as effectively as did retinol .  Each of two isomers of retinol ,  13 - cis and 11 , 13 - di - cis - retinol ,  bound to apo - RBP to some extent .  The 13 - cis isomer appeared to bind somewhat less effectively than did the 11 , 13 - di - cis isomer .  The binding of retinol to RBP is highly but not absolutely specific . '},\n",
