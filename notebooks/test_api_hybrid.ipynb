Infection of chicken embryo cells with vesicular stomatitis  ( VS )  virus resulted in variable production of three classes of intracellular viral ribonucleocapsids with sedimentation coefficients of approximately 140S ,  110S ,  and 80S ,  as well as three corresponding classes of released virions designated B ,  LT ,  and T .  Intracellular nucleocapsids of each class contained three proteins of which the major N protein was firmly bound ,  and the minor L and NS1 proteins were readily dissociated with 0 . 5 m NaCl .  The ribonucleic acid  ( RNA )  species extracted from B ,  LT ,  and T virions ,  and from corresponding intracellular nucleocapsids ,  contained RNA species with approximate molecular weights of 3 . 2 x 10 ( 6 )  ,  2 . 0 x 10 ( 6 )  ,  and 10 ( 6 )  ,  respectively ,  as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .  These values are roughly equivalent to sedimentation coefficients of 42S ,  28S ,  and 23S for each of the virion and nucleocapsid RNA species .  Cells infected at high multiplicity with undiluted passage VS virus gave rise primarily to virions and nucleocapsids containing 23S RNA ,  whereas cells productively infected with purified B virions produced predominantly B and LT virions and nucleocapsids .  At late stages in the productive cycle of infection ,  more virions containing 42S RNA were produced ,  but the intracellular pool of nucleocapsids containing 28S and 23S RNA remained relatively constant .  Additional studies by more refined techniques are required to test the hypothesis that nucleocapsids containing 28S and 23S RNA are precursors of the 42S RNA in infectious VS - B virions and that production of defective T and LT virions results from failure of ligation of the RNA precursors . \"\n",

An approach to distinguishing hypothalamic from pituitary forms of idiopathic hypopituitary dwarfism .  To test the hypothesis that the primary defect in some patients with idiopathic hypopituitary dwarfism is failure to secrete hypothalamic hypophysiotropic - releasing factors ,  synthetic thyrotropin - releasing factor  ( TRF )  ,  500 mug ,  wa given intravenously ,  and timed venous samples obtained for determination of the concentration of plasma TSH by radioimmunoassay in three groups of subjects :   ( a )  11 patients without evidence of endocrine or systemic disease ,   ( group I )   ( b )  8 with isolated growth hormone deficiency and normal thyroid function ,   ( group II )  and  ( c )  9 patients with idiopathic hypopituitary dwarfism and thyroid - stimulating hormone  ( TSH )  deficiency  ( group III )  .  The mean fasting plasma TSH value was 4 . 1 muU / ml in group I ,  and 3 . 9 muU / ml in group II ;  in both groups there was a brisk rise in plasma TSH to peak levels of 12 - 45 muU / ml at 30 - 45 min ,  and a fall toward base line levels at 120 min .  All children in group III had basal TSH levels of  <  1 . 5 muU / ml ;  one failed to respond to TRF ;  eight exhibited a rise in plasma TSH with peak values comparable with those in groups I and II .  In four of eight children in group III who responded to TRF ,  the TSH response was delayed and the initial rise in plasma TSH was not detectable until 10 - 60 min .  In these four patients ,  plasma TSH levels continued to rise at 120 min .  The mean fasting concentration of plasma thyroxine iodide  ( T ( 4 )  )  in subjects with normal thyroid function  ( groups I and II )  was 5 . 6 mug / 100 ml ,  and the mean plasma T ( 4 )  level at 120 min was 6 . 6 mug / 100 ml .  This difference between fasting and postTRF plasma T ( 4 )  was significant  ( P  <  0 . 001 )  by paired analysis .  Mean fasting plasma T ( 4 )  concentration in group III patients was 1 . 3 mug / 100 ml ;  after TRF a significant rise in T ( 4 )  concentration was not detected in this group .  The results indicate that TRF test is useful in distinguishing between primary hypothalamic and pituitary forms of TSH deficiency .  In light of the evidence of TRF deficiency in eight of nine patients with idiopathic hypopituitary dwarfism ,  it seems likely that in these patients ,  other pituitary hormone deficiencies may be attributable to deficiency of their respective releasing factors . \"\n",

Injection of single doses of 500 mug by intravenous ,  subcutaneous ,  and intramuscular routes caused only small and transient reductions in GH levels ,  though the effect was improved by injecting the hormone intramuscularly in 2 ml of 16 %  gelatin .  Injection of a suspension of 4 mg GHRIH in 1 ml of arachis oil lowered growth hormone levels for between three and four hours .  In four acromegalic patients an oral 50 - g glucose tolerance test was performed during a continuous infusion of either saline or 1 , 000 mug GHRIH .  The  \\\" paradoxical \\\"  rise in growth hormone seen in these patients during the saline infusion was suppressed by GHRIH .  The blood glucose responses were ,  moreover ,  modified by GHRIH in that the peak was delayed and occurred at the end of the infusion in each case .  A  \\\" normal \\\"  glucose tolerance curve was converted to a  \\\" diabetic \\\"  type of response in two patients .  This effect could be accounted for by the inhibition of insulin secretion known to occur with large doses of GHRIH . We speculate that acromegaly may be primarily a hypothalmic disease due to deficiency of GHRIH resulting in excessive secretion of growth hormone from the pituitary and adenoma formation due to inappropriate and prolonged stimulation of the pituitary . \"\n",

The present studies demonstrate that the factor B - dependent C3 convertase can be affixed to an erythrocyte by use of an intermediate bearing C3b and that this convertase brings the hemolytic reaction to completion with an efficiency comparable to that of classical convertase .  The evidence that the EAC43 intermediate was lysed by a new pathway includes requirements for factors B and D and cell - bound C3b for subsequent lysis by the terminal components ,  C3 - C9 .  The linear stoichiometry of the effective molecule titrations of C3b and factor B ,  and the first - order kinetics displayed by the generation and decay of the factor B - dependent hemolytic site are characteristics consistent with the one - hit theory as initially developed for the classical complement system .  The use of hemolytically active cellular intermediates to examine the reactions occurring with C3b and factors B and D has allowed extension of the one - hit theory to this molecular sequence ,  development of effective molecule titrations ,  recognition of the analogies to the functional characteristics of the classical C3 convertase ,  and discrimination of the probable mechanism of terminal complement activation from reactive lysis . \"\n",

Repetitive administration of thyrotropin - releasing hormone  ( TRH )  to human subjects was used to produce small elevations of endogenous serum triiodothyronine  ( T ( 3 )  )  and thyroxine  ( T ( 4 )  )  levels and thereby to determine the effect of these small elevations on the serum thyrotropin  ( TSH )  response to subsequent doses of TRH .  Each subject received 13 consecutive doses of 25 mug TRH at 4 - h intervals .  Serum T ( 3 )  ,  T ( 4 )  ,  and TSH levels were measured before the 1st ,  7th ,  and 13th doses  (  \\\" basal levels \\\"  )  and for the 4 h after each of these doses .  In 10 normal subjects ,  the mean TSH response fell from 14 . 6 muU / ml after the 1st TRH dose to 6 . 9 and 3 . 0 muU / ml after the 7th ,  and 13th doses .  These falls in TSH response were accompanied by rises in the mean basal serum T ( 3 )  levels from 81 to 115 to 114 ng / 100 ml  ( normal range ,  70 - 150 ng / 100 ml )  and rises in the mean basal serum T ( 4 )  from 6 . 7 to 8 . 6 to 9 . 5 mug / 100 ml  ( normal range ,  5 - 11 mug / 100 ml )  .  These data suggest that TRH - induced TSH release is extremely sensitive to inhibition by small elevations ,  not above the normal ranges ,  of serum T ( 3 )  and T ( 4 )  of endogenous origin .  In four patients with primary hypothyroidism ,  the mean TSH responses were 92 ,  137 ,  and 92 muU / ml after the 1st ,  7th ,  and 13th TRH doses .  The corresponding mean basal serum T ( 3 )  and T ( 4 )  levels at the times of these doses were 34 ,  30 ,  and 32 ng / 100 ml and 1 . 9 ,  1 . 9 ,  and 1 . 7 mug / 100 ml .  These data show that repetitive administration of TRH does not result in progressively lower TSH responses in the absence of corresponding increases in serum T ( 3 )  and T ( 4 )  level .  The progressive fall in TSH response observed in the normal subjects ,  therefore ,  was apparently due to the corresponding small increases in serum T ( 3 )  and T ( 4 )  levels and not to progressive depletion of pituitary TSH .  In two patients with presumed TRH deficiency ,  the TSH responses were blunted by repetitive TRH doses but only when the serum T ( 3 )  and T ( 4 )  levels increased to within the normal ranges .  TRH deficiency was thus confirmed for the first time by producing euthyroidism by replacement of TRH . \"\n",

Neuraminidase free of proteolytic activity substantially reduced the infectivity of vesicular stomatitis  ( VS )  virus but less effectively than trypsin .

Desialylation of virion glycoprotein but not of glycolipid resulted in progressive loss of infectivity .  Sialyl transferase prepared and partially purified from BHK - 21 cells catalyzed resialylation by CMP -  [  ( 14 ) C ] sialic acid of the glycoprotein of neuraminidase - treated VS virions and supersialylation of unhydrolyzed VS viral glycoprotein .

An 8 - month - old female ,  maintained on breast feeding for 6 months ,  experienced numerous attacks of hyperventilation when weaned to baby food and was admitted with severe lactic acidosis  ( 20 mM )  and hypoglycemia .  Physical examination was negative except for hepatomegaly .  Fasting  ( 18 hr )  after stabilization on a high carbohydrate diet resulted in hypoglycemia  ( plasma glucose 40 mg / 100 ml )  ,  lactic acidosis  ( 6 - 10 mM )  ,  and a rise in plasma alanine .  Glucagon produced a glycemic response after 6 hr ,  but not after 18 hr fasting .  Intravenous galactose increased plasma glucose  ( Delta 45 mg / 100 ml )  but intravenous fructose ,  glycerol ,  and alanine caused a 40 - 50 %  fall in plasma glucose and a significant rise in lactate  ( Delta 3 - 4 mM )  .  Liver biopsy showed fatty infiltration .  Liver slices incubated with galactose ,  lactate ,  fructose ,  alanine ,  or glycerol converted only galactose to glucose .  Hepatic glycolytic intermediates were increased below the level of fructose - 1 , 6 - diphosphate and decreased above .  Hepatic phosphorylase ,  glucose - 6 - phosphatase ,  amylo - 1 , 6 - glucosidase ,  phosphofructokinase ,  fructose - 1 - phosphate aldolase ,  and fructose - 1 , 6 - diphosphate aldolase levels were normal ,  but no fructose - 1 , 6 - diphosphatase  ( FDPase )  activity was detected .  Further studies on the liver homogenate of this patient revealed the presence of an acid - precipitable activator of FDPase .  Normal plasma glucose and lactate levels were maintained on an 800 cal diet of 66 %  carbohydrate  ( sucrose and fructose excluded )  .  5 %  protein ,  and 20 %  fat .  When carbohydrate was reduced to 35 %  and protein or fat increased to 23 and 53 %  respectively ,  lactic acidosis and hypoglycemia recurred .  These studies show that a deficiency of FDPase produced infantile lactic acidosis and hypoglycemia and can be controlled by an appropriate diet . \"\n",
